# ðŸš€ Grey to Green
## About
**Grey to Green** is an ongoing machine learning project to develop a modle that can estimate urban parking stock to identify opportunities for repurposing underutilized parking spaces in London (and hopefully other cities).

This repo contains the necessary raw data, scripts, and results from my research for reproduction purposes.
